            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <div>
                <p>My project focused on forecasting fashion trends for the next decade based on my own predictions. The target audience is young adults in their 20s who will be entering their 30s during this time. My goal was to show how fashion is shaped by our environmentâ€”ranging from technology and the economy to culture, celebrities, and more.</p>

                <img src="images/vogue.png">

                <p>I began by looking at websites that informed me on trends and the first one that came to mind was Vogue. I browsed through the trends section on the Vogue website and was reading through several headlines. Their website features many sources of influence fashion today. Since the website was blocked as it requires payment I mainly used it to observe the fashion and silhouettes of many designers work and made my own inferences throughout the website. Vogue provides great current trends only for a year ahead but doesn't always delve in on what the future might entail beyond a year. Although it is a great resource it is also not fully open to the public and therefore limited content is able to be seen.</p>

                <p>I also researched the WGSN website which focuses on Trend Forecasting and Analysis. This website has a blog where they discuss color trends, future fashion trend predictions, dissect fashion shows and dive into social media's impact on modern day trends. It is a great resource for looking at design trends within the next 1-3 years across all industries. I feel that this website was useful to browse because it talks about the inluence of emotions on fashion, popular color trends, microtrends and more.</p>

            <h2>Visual Design</h2>
            <div>
                <img src="images/visual.png">
                <p>In terms of visual design I wanted it to remain very minimalistic. I wanted the webpage to be more content focused in addition most fashion magazines and websites such as vogue tend to feature more whitespace. I also used the Fig as the main H1 and H2 font due to it's digital vibe and to complement it for any secondary text I used Avenir LT Pro. I mainly kept the colors as neutral for any accompanying text to have the main focus be aligned towards the images in this case my fashion prediction illustrations.   </p>.</p>

    <section id="ui">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>User Interface</h2>
                <div>
                    <img src="images/uiprev.png"
                    <p>For the user interface I wanted it to once again remain very minimalistic. Most of my text is black to draw the users atteniton to the color on the page which entails the outfits. My first few sections focused on introducing how our environment affect trends through different sectors. Afterwards we dive into my predictions and end the experience with a gallery of the overall fashion predictions. Within each predicted outfit there are two sections that highlight the outfits detail and some of my own personal commentary for context.</p>

    <section id="revisions">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Revisions</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>I had to improve the readability of each outfit description for the users. The text was overwhelming and scrolling through several of these could cause a loss of interest. So I opted towards changing the long paragraph descriptions to bullet points. I also bolded keywords I wanted the user to notice. in addition to that I added a top section of all the dates for the outfits listed. I wanted the user to be able to see all the following dates in line. Towards the end I also added a gallery so the user can see a summary of what they previously scrolled through. </p>

                <p>I further experimented with using Javascript Libraries such as Animate On Scroll. Using the library was pretty easy which allowed animations to be integrated seamlessly. I also worked a bit more using grids on HTM/CSS which is something I haven't used in a while since I usually opt for using flex box. It was a journey to finish the project and I also experimented with drawing on my own through procreate which was a bit diffult. The file transfers were also a bit difficut since cropping out each image was not the easiest task but in the end it was nice to see them all together in the gallery.</p>
